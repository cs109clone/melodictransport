            <h3>Getting old</h3>
            <p>In 2014, older households (those with a reference person 55 years and older) made up 41.5 percent of the CE sample, compared with 37.5 percent in 2009 and 34.6 percent in 2004, reflecting the aging of the U.S. population.</p>
            <p>
                Housing was the greatest expense in dollar terms ($16,219) and as a share of annual expenditures (32.9 percent) for olderhouseholds. Spending was greatest ($18,006) for the 55–64 age group, decreasing to $15,838 for the 65–74 group before declining to $13,375 for the 75-and-older group. The statistically significant decline in dollar expenditure reflects the decline in mortgage debt among households. Among older homeowner households, 59.5 percent were mortgage free. The proportion of homeowners without mortgage debt was 44.2 percent for the 55–64 age group, 61.7 percent for the 65–74 group, and 82.5 percent for the 75-and-older group.

            <h3>Don't need to spend to have fun (when you're old)</h3>
            <p>Entertainment spending averaged $2,604 for the group as a whole. The difference between the $2,852 spent by the 55–64 age group and the $2,988 spent by the 65–74 age group was not statistically different. The $1,626 spent by the 75-and older group was statistically different from the amounts spent by the other age groups.7 Existing studies using CE data found that, other factors being equal, entertainment spending declines with age.
