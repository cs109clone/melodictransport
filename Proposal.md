Title: The American consumer -- what do we spend our money on? 

Our proposal is to explore how American consumer spending trends have changed overtime. Using time-series data from the annual Consumer Expenditure Survey published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we aim to create a series of visualizations that show how certain categories have grown (such as housing and healthcare) while others have become a smaller part of American consumer budgets. Our goal is that our visualizations will show high-level general trends while also allowing users to zoom-in on specific categories that are interesting. Weâ€™d also like users to be able to filter the data by race, income, educational level, region, and perhaps other criteria, to visualize how spending changes vary across different socio-economic categories. Additionally, visualizations can be enhanced by comparing overtime consumer spending trends with timelines of interesting events in recent American history (military actions, stock market values, major weather events/natural disasters, presidential party, major legislation, etc).
