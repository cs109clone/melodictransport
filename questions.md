## Some questions


### Children / Family spending

* How much do children cost / how much do people spend on family?
*  How does it vary across regions and other dimensions?
* How has that changed over time and some guesses as to why?
* What are differences in spending between households with children and those without?
* Could also frame this as, as the number of Children per Household goes down, the amount we're spending per child goes up 

### Contributions

* How do contributions to educational, political, religious organizations, and charities vary over dimenisons, such as:
	*  Time?
	*  Region?
	*  Household income?
	*  Education Level?


### Educational expenses

Show the evolution of the cost of education across time.

* How have education costs changed over time?
* What percentage of household income is spent on education over various dimensions, such as?
	*  Time?
	*  Region?
	*  Household income?
	*  Education Level?



### "Market Basket", CPI

This is an interesting measure of the way prices of goods and services changes over time, such that it tracks 
changes in cost of living. 
* What is the correlation between changes in wages and changes in cost of living? 


### Correlations to external events

* What is the relationship between US consumer spending over time and:
 * prevailing political party control?
 * prevailing stock market conditions?
 * gas prices? (Specifically is the a discernible connection between gas prices and transportation costs) 
 * other commodity prices?

* Are there discernable patterns in US consumer spending as a reaction to significant events, such as:
	* 9/11 and other military events?
	* Natural disasters (Kitrina, Tsunamis (south asia/japan), etc.)?
	* Stock market events (i.e. single-day/week crashes)?
	* Elections?
	
### Longitudinal spending changes over the last century  

* The rise and fall of big box stores. For example, it would be cool if we had an animated map where you could see the spread of stores such as Walmart, Target, and Best buy throughout the 1990s, only to see them start retreating around 2008 or so. This combined with some data about aggregate spending in big-box stores vs. online and/or small retailers could be interesting visualization of this trend. 

* The change in American spending patterns over the last century: Although the BLS survey has been collected annually in recent years, the original survey data goes all the way back to 1880 (collected every 10 years). The changes in spending patterns are most dramatic when you look over a long period of time. For example, in 1901, the average american spent 42% of their income on food. By 2003, that share had fallen to 13%. Spending on transportation (all forms) grew from basically nothing in 1901 to ~20% in 2003. This report (http://www.bls.gov/opub/uscs/home.htm) is the best summary of the types of stories we could tell with this data, and it's all based on the BLS survey data.  There are probably more interesting long term stories that could be told about aggregate Americans -- i.e., the declining cost of food, the increasing cost of health care, the incress of other "non-essential expenditures" etc.
